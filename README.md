# Test application created with ReactJS for XWERX

###### How was the application built?

The application was built using the REACTJS framework, therefore it was build using different UI components. Some of them are reused throughtout the application

At the top we can find the Chart section with the Options dropleft, which is one of the two components with which you can interact with.

In the bottom you will find the data section, in which headers you can find the "Undo/Load data" icon, which is the second component with which you can interact with.

The rest of components are dummy and only UI representative

The application is prepared to make a fake API call to request data, so as to represent that data into the charts and the data section

###### How to use it

First of all, please select a Data type on the dropleft located at the top left of the app. Once selected click the "Undo/Load data" icon. You can change the Data type as many times as you want.

Thanks and happy christmas!!
